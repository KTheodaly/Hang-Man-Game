# Hang-Man-Game
## What is this repo project?

* This is a word guess game like hangman created using Javascript. 

## How does it work?

* The user inputs a letter guess, if that letter is in the word it will show the letter, if not, the letter will appear in a wrong guess div and add a body to our "man".
* The website relies on Javascript loops, buttons, and functions to power the game.

## Who will use this repo?

* This is for coursework utilizing Javascript, but is open to anyone who wants to explore the code or play with it for fun.

## What is the goal of the project?

* Generate a random word.
* When the user guesses a letter, it either reveals the letter in the word or goes to the incorrect guesses.
* Letters should hide until the user guesses them.
* Alert the user if they win by correctly guessing the word, or lose by having too many incorrect guesses.
* Keep a tally of wins and losses.
